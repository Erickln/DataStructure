The phone is great but if it needs service, don't count on Samsung to do what they promise. My phone arrived with a scratch in the Gorilla Glass. I talked to a Samsung rep who said they would for sure repair that and we arranged to have my phone sent in. They ask you to send in the charger and cable too, so I did. After a week, I received a $300 quote for the repair I was told would be no charge. By the end of the call, they agreed to fix the scratched glass. Another week went by and I received my phone completely unrepaired and missing my charger and cable. I called back and the rep I spoke to said the repair was approved but somehow it was never authorized so they just sent my phone back to me. After further discussion, they PROMISED to take care of the screen and asked me to send in my phone. I trusted their promise and sent in my phone. After two weeks, I received my phone back, again unrepaired. Another call to customer service later and they couldn't tell me whether they were simply inept or if they had just lied to me. The experience has left me sour for not only Samsung phones but for all other Samsung products as well. As far as I'm concerned, if it's a Samsung, it's not going into my house. ",Amazon,NULL

A device that has ushered in a new era of design in Samsung’s mobile division. Now, Samsung’s “Best smartphone ever” is a year old. So, How does it hold up in 2018? I’m going to preface this piece by saying that I haven’t bought a flagship since 2015, with the release of the iPhone 6S in 16GB. Since 2015 smartphones have changed A LOT. Bezels in flagships have become a passé thing. And releasing a flagship with bezels in 2018 seems more of a taboo than a design flaw. Bezels in a 2018 flagship are considered unacceptable by most critics. And in some ways I can see why but we’ll talk about that later. For now let’s do a basic overview of this device. The Samsung Galaxy S8 was released in early 2017 with a QUALCOMM snapdragon 835 SOC, an Adreno 540 Graphics chip, 4 Gigabytes of RAM, and 64GB’s of storage. Compared to other 2017 flagships, these specs aren’t anything special, however one thing separates from the rest. The design of the phone. The curved back, and curved display with a marginally thin side lip, makes for a phone that molds into your hand. The glass front and back also makes the device very slippery in the hands. Which for me, isn’t a good thing. While it’s aesthetic is beautiful, I need a case on this thing to give me the grip I like. On the bottom of the device we see USB-C, a admittedly small bottom firing speaker, and surprise, a headphone jack. On the sides you’ll find a power button as well as the volume rocker and bixby button. On the top you’ll find a sim + micro sd card slot. And on the rear you’ll find a fingerprint sensor on the right of the 13 megapixel camera lens, and flash + heartrate monitor. But let’s go back to the headphone jack for a second. As I mentioned earlier my phone has been the iPhone 6S for about two years now, and headphone jacks for me are STILL a must have. My 3.5mm earpods work fine, so why replace them? I’m glad the S8 kept the headphone jack, it’s a breath of fresh air in a market where less is apparently more. And, in some respects the S8 nails what “Less is more” means. With this philosophy being most prominent in the display. The Screen The Screen of the Galaxy s8 is a beautiful Quad HD AMOLED panel with a unique 18:9 aspect ratio that takes up most of the front side of the phone, and this is a good thing. No longer do we see large bezels that do nothing for the device. In a way the display is not only more beautiful but also more utilitarian. The more screen real estate makes for a more satisfying experience in some apps, allowing one to be fully immersed in the content. While not every app is optimized for this screen ratio, a decent number of apps are, and the ones that aren’t optimized are easy to make them look nice and fill the display. The panel itself has Vivid and bright colors that aren’t as saturated as Samsung displays usually are, they are a little truer to life. The curved glass makes a return from the S7 Edge, a welcome inclusion to not only the design but the functionality. The edge tab, while not for everyone has made my experience with the device very interesting. It’s customization is awesome allowing you to choose what information to show, so your never flipping through any useless panels. The edge lighting on the display is also helpful for notifications. The Viewing angles in the display are also very good. Colors are nice and smooth in a wide variety of viewing angles, and the very bright capability of the display also helps viewing angle quite a bit to mitigate reflection from lights and the sun, so no matter what angle your viewing the display from you’ll almost always get a good clear picture from the phone. Overall, this phone has one of the best and brightest displays around, even today in 2018. So, how does Samsung utilize these features in Software? The OS The Galaxy S8 originally shipped with android 7.0 Nougat with Samsung Experience 8.0, but now Android 8.0 Oreo is available for this device and with it brings Samsung Experience 9.0 to the table. We see a return of all the features from Nougat, with some little added features in Oreo, that without much investigation could go unnoticed. But, these features are very helpful to the user experience over stock android. The Launcher is intuitive and very customizable which is something I enjoy out of the box! The setup process is very easy to get through, it felt very iPhone like, which is a very good thing. The ability to change the button layout is also a very nice touch that allows the user to change it to their liking, this feature is not available on stock android, but it is present here which is all the much appreciated! The facial unlock, while not iPhone X level Is much more intuitive than it used to be, it is also for the most part pretty fast and accurate, the software also makes it very easy to register a face. Google Assistant and Samsung Bixby is baked right into android. Google assistant is my preferred assistant just because of my previous usage history. Bixby is the new-comer to the digital assistant game. While it’s good, it’s not great. Some things it doesn’t understand yet, and overall to me it seems like a half-baked effort. But that’s not to say it isn’t getting better so my opinion might change as Samsung updates Bixby over time. Side note to Bixby, The Bixby button as mentioned in the overview is a button located under the volume rocker, it is mapped n default to launch Bixby by default, which is annoying. It can be remapped to launch something else using a third-party app, but other than that the button is quite useless in the software experience. If you are switching from iPhone to Samsung, the software may be a learning curve but once you get the hang of it, it is quite nice, although Samsung’s emoji are quite weird compared to the iPhone and some emojis don’t show up at all or are completely different than the iPhone counterpart. If you are switching from another device or android phone, the interface might be a little heavy to say than what you’re used to, so tread with caution if you love stock android. While the software brings many new features it also lacks consistent security patches. You will get a security patch every 2 – 3 months, but it’s not as consistent as I would like. Security is important to me, and I don’t like the idea that I’m not on the latest and greatest security patch, however if you can look over this, as it’s quite nitpicky than you’ll probably love the Samsung software on your phone. The Camera In 2018 smartphones have become the go-to camera for most casual smartphone users. We expect our cameras to take good pictures of us, our family, our children, our adventures in life. And to put it simply, the rear camera is AMAZING! It still does very well in 2018 against other flagships. It’s quick auto mode allows amazing shots to be taken without any input from the user. The integrated pro mode also allows the inner photographer inside stretch its legs, with ISO and shutter speed controls just to name a few being present. There are other rear camera modes that will help in certain scenarios but often auto and pro mode will be plenty for taking pictures. The rear camera will give you shots that are Instagram worthy. The front facing camera is more mediocre. It takes OK, selfies and the automatic face enhancing features can sometimes make one’s face look plastic. But once face filters have been turned off, in good lighting the front camera can produce some good selfies, not AW inspiring ones but, decent ones nether the less. Video recording is of course present, and the rear camera is optically stabilized so shooting smooth and stunning video is no problem. 4K recording is also here, but it can be shaky and isn’t as sharp as I would like for 4K. The front camera also has video but It is not stabilized so video from this selfie cam can be shaky. Also please note, if you are a heavy snapchat user, this camera does not play nice with snapchat due to the lack of optimization from snap inc. So photos look noticeably worse than what the normal camera app would take, I would highly suggest sticking with the stock camera for most picture taking needs. The Tradeoffs This phone despite all of it’s great highlight features has some flaw you want to consider. The fingerprint sensor can be hard to find due to it’s close proximity to the camera. The Speaker isn’t that loud and can easily be muffled by your hand depending on how you hold it. The phone also is very easy to drop, and Gorilla glass 5 while great, won’t always save you from an accidental drop. So always have some sort of extra grip on the device to protect it. In stressful tasks it can also get hot and drain the battery, so try not to push it too hard all the time. Overall This phone in 2018 is an amazing device still. Consider it if the S9 or note 8 are too expensive. This is as close you’ll get to a modern phone that is also fast and very sleek! Despite it being a year old, it’s age isn’t showing at all! I love it! Features not mentioned: IP 68 Water and dust resistance Wireless charging Iris scanning Samsung pay ",Amazon,NULL

It's sleek and attractive. The hardware is beefy--64GB is more than enough for me. And if I did need more, it's nice that I have the option of using a micro SD card. The processor and ram have nice performance on apps. Some people complain about the fingerprint sensor being near the camera. Personally, I haven't had a problem with that. Nor have I had a problem with the Bixby button, although it seems unnecessary. The iris scanner, however, doesn't seem to work for me. I'm just not using that function. The deduction of a star comes in Samsung's software. It's not bad. But there are going to be times where you are banging your head in frustration--'Why won't you let me do ________? or why won't you let me remove _______ from MY PHONE?' For some people, that may be Bixby. Personally I'm using it in conjunction with Google Assistant and that seems to be working well. But for those that don't want it, you really shouldn't need 3rd party software to remove it. Likewise, if you have an app that you prefer to use, then Samsung shouldn't place a barrier to keep you from removing their version. It was great that they included some apps with a new phone; I get that. But if I want to get rid of them in favor of something else, I shouldn't have to jump through hoops. And then there are odd situations like Samsung's built in Game Tools. Now I'm not a heavy gamer, but there are times I'll mindlessly kill some time. But that stinkin setting was adding 2 extra buttons on the navigation screen in the corners right near the game's buttons. When I finally managed to kill the buttons, I was getting notifications all the time when the game started-up as well as inconvenient places in the game. It took a $2.50 purchase for an app called BK Disabler to finally get rid of it. It's not a lot in the scheme of things. But man, what an aggravating experience for an otherwise solid & great phone!

It is a budget phone pretending it wants to be a $600 phone. First week of owning it without any drops, a few random columns of the phone turned pink, wont go back. The charging port only works about 60% of the time. The other 40 % of the time will say that it has moisture in the port and will refuse to charge. After the first 3 months the phone becomes extremely sluggish when moving between apps and different home screens, while I am use to this slowdown on mobile devices, this is the only time it started slowing down before I had owned it for a single quarter. This phone will give you about as much functionality as one of those old Nokia phones with how sluggish, inconsistent and poorly constructed it is. ",Amazon,NULL

After owning this new Samsung Galaxy S8 for a couple weeks now, there really is no comparison to my old phone. It's almost like going from a black and white 13"" TV with rabbit ear antennas to a 39"" HD flat screen with high speed cable. I only mention this to offer perspective in the event some feel I have over fluffed this product in my review. The phone arrived precisely as advertised. Neatly boxed with instructions, corded head-set, charger with USB adapter fittings, and Sim/SD card remover tool. Upon removal from the box I could find no flaws or blemishes. It started right up and had a 50% charge on the battery. I was immediately able to connect it to my high speed home wifi. Afterwards, I just browsed a bit on the internet to get a feel for it and immediately noticed that it was insanely faster than my previous phone but the biggest glaring difference was the clarity and crispness of the display. Not wanting to tempt fate, I forced myself to stop playing with it long enough to get it in a protector case and apply a glass protector to the face. Even with the glass protector, there was no noticeable difference in the display. The sound was very sharp as well. I played around with it a bit more but then had to run over to the Verizon store to get them to put a SIM card in it since I already had a service plan with them. Once I got there, it literally took 5 minutes for a Verizon representative to find my account and put a new SIM card in the phone. After that it was a simple restart and I was full connected. After I returned home I was able to download all of my previous content from the Verizon cloud using my high speed wifi. After that it was business as usual except now it was faster, cleaner, sharper, and just all-around better than that old Droid Razr Max. I admit though that I can't bring myself to ditch Google voice for Bixby. I have heard from many that Bixby doesn't compare so I haven't tried it. If there is an issue with the phone it is that I sometimes accidently enable Bixby with an inadvertent swipe in the wrong direction or tap of the button on the bottom left side. I will eventually try it out an update this review later. After having the phone a couple of weeks now, I am still extremely please with this phone. I've had no performance issues whatsoever. Navigating through the net, apps, settings, etc. is quite painless. Photos are very clear even with my unsteady hands. I will update this review with anything I feel is worthy later. Good or bad. Right now I highly recommend this phone if you are looking for one. ",Amazon,NULL

I was using it fine. One day failed to start. 2. Sent in for repair on 8/18/18. 3. Just got it back on 8/31/18. 4. Samsung did not fix it. The letter came with the phone said simply, ""unable to fix"" 5. Called Samsung. Was on hold for 32 min. After several transfers, I was told there was a liquid damage. 6. How can there be a liquid damage when it never went near water? 7. Isn't Samsung Galaxy S8 water resistant to begin with? 8. It took Samsung over 10 days to determine that there is a water damage? 9. I have had many Samsung products in the past. I have to confess it will take a lot for me to consider Samsung again. ",Amazon,NULL

Apparently, this phone has an issue with NOT being able to send sms texts. Spent 2 hours in the Verizon store trying to get it sorted out. 2 factory resets, and 2 additional SIM cards - still will not send SMS texts. Besides the no texting problem, the other issues I found in the short time I had this phone is: -The new 'Bixby' feature is a huge disappointment. Extra side button which is easily hit by holding the phone. Fingerprint reader is in an awkward position on the back of the camera. Unable to use thumb print unless turning phone around. So, if you're just looking for an expensive phone without the ability to respond to texts, or constantly pulling up Samsung's attempt at AI whenever you pick up the phone - then this one is a winner. If you're looking to actually use all of your phone's capabilities - then I suggest going elsewhere. I've been with Samsung since the Galaxy S1 days, and this is by far, the WORST phone I have ever encountered (and I even had the Note 7 for a short time). Returning this POS. ",Amazon,NULL
